# Project 2 : Treaps

A treap is a randomized binary search tree built by merging the key ideas in heaps and binary search tree. That is, a treap follows thr binary search tree property (for each node, the values of all of the nodes to the right are bigger than the value of the node, and smaller for the nodes to the left). The node of a treap also holds a random number. A treap satisfies the heap property by that random number.

The average time complexity for insert, search and delete is O(log n).
