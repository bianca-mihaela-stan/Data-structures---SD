# Data-structures --- Dumitran Marius
1st year, 2nd semester, a course taught by Dumitran Marius

This course went through:

1. **Sorting algorithms**
    see <a href="https://github.com/stanbianca/Data-structures/tree/master/Project%201">Project 1</a>: an analysis of different sorting algorithms and their complexities
    
2. **Linear data structures**:
- Linked Lists
- Queues
- Stacks
- Deques
- Heaps:
  - Proprity Heaps
  - Binomial Heaps
  - Fibonacci Heaps
  - Treaps ( you can see my inplementation of Treaps here: <a href="https://github.com/stanbianca/Data-structures/tree/master/Project%202">Project 2</a> )
  - Huffman Codes (you can see my presentation on the Optimality of Huffman Codes here: <a href="https://github.com/stanbianca/Data-structures/blob/master/Optimality%20of%20Huffman%20Code.pdf">Presentation</a> )
  
3. **Binary Search Trees**:
- BSTs
- AVLs
- Skip Lists

4. **Segment Trees**
- Square Root Decomposition Technique
- Segment Trees
- Range Minimum Query
- Lowest Common Ancestor

5. **Hashing**

My 3rd and final project for this course was solving about 50 problems on the topics the course went through. You can see the project here: <a href="https://github.com/stanbianca/Data-structures/tree/master/Project%203">Project 3</a>
